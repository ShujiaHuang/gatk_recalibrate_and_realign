This app applies a number of recalculations to a Mappings object in order to
improve the quality of variant calls. The process follows the Broad Institute's
recommendations for best practices in variant calling. Mappings are
deduplicated, realigned around sites of known indels, and their quality is
recalibrated by looking at covariance in quality metrics with frequently
observed variation in the genome.
