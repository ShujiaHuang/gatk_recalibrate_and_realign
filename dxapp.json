  "summary": "Performs the Broad Institute's best practices in SNP and Indel calling v3.",
  "description": "This app applies a number of recalculations to a mappings object in order to improve the quality of variant calls. This follows the Broad Institutes recommendations for best practices in variant calling. Mappings are deduplicated, realigned around sites of known indels, and their quality is recalibrated by looking at covariance in quality metrics with frequently observed variation in the genome.",
